MODULE: GSL/XML package

    Class: XML
    
        Function: XML . new ([name])
                Creates a free 'unattached' XML item.  In reality it is attached to the
    global variable ancestor, but only so that GSL can de-allocate it on
    termination.

    Therefore if the GSL script does not deallocate the item, it will remain
    until GSL shuts down.

        Function: XML . load_string (string,[error])
                Loads the supplied string as an XML item.
    Returns a pointer to the (first) resulting XML item or undefined if there
    was an error.  In the latter case, an error message is placed in the
    parameter 'error' and in the XML thread context.

        Function: XML . load_file (filename,[error])
                Loads the file with the supplied name as an XML item.
    Returns a pointer to the (first) resulting XML item or undefined if there
    was an error.  In the latter case, an error message is placed in the
    parameter 'error' and in the XML thread context.


    Class: XML item
    
        Function: <XML item> . deleted ()
                Returns TRUE if the XML item has been deleted.

        Function: <XML item> . prev ()
                Returns the previous XML item.

        Function: <XML item> . string ()
                Returns the XML item formatted as a string.

        Function: <XML item> . load_string (string,[error])
                Loads the supplied string as a child of the item.
    Returns a pointer to the (first) resulting XML item or undefined if there
    was an error.  In the latter case, an error messa   ge is placed in the
    parameter 'error' and in the XML thread context.

        Function: <XML item> . load_file (filename,[error])
                Loads the file with the supplied name as a child of the item.
    Returns a pointer to the (first) resulting XML item or undefined if there
    was an error.  In the latter case, an error message is placed in the
    parameter 'error' and in the XML thread context.

        Function: <XML item> . save (filename,[error])
                Saves the XML item to a file with the given name.  Any file errors are
    places in the parameter 'error' and in the XML thread context.  Returns
    zero if no error occurred, errno otherwise.
