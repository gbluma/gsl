MODULE: GSL/thrd package

    Class: Thread
    
        Function: thread . parse (command,[error])
                Parses the command, placing any error message in the parameter 'error'.
    Errors can also be recovered via thread class attributes.
    If successful, returns an object of type 'parsed item' which can
    then be run as many times as necessary, saving the need to re-parse
    each time.

        Function: thread . new (command,[error])
                Parses and runs the command, placing any error message in the parameter
    'error'.   Errors can also be recovered via thread class and child thread
    object attributes.   If the parsing was successful, returns an object
    of type 'child thread'.

        Function: thread . sleep (csecs)
                Puts the current thread to sleep for the specified number of centiseconds.
    Returns -1 if csecs is invalid.

        Function: thread . receive ([receive])
                Receives a message from the thread's message queue.  If the queue is empty,
    the thread sleeps until a message is available.

    Places a reference to the sending thread in the first parameter.  Places
    arbitrary values from the message into successive parameters.


    Class: Thread
    
        Function: <remote thread> . send ()
                Sends a message with an arbitrary number of arguments to the thread.


    Class: Thread
    
        Function: <child thread> . interrupt ()
                Shuts down the thread.

        Function: <child thread> . send ()
                Sends a message with an arbitrary number of arguments to the thread.


    Class: Thread
    
        Function: <parsed item> . run ([error])
